This website consists of a main index page with links to a few recipes using html and css.

This was a fun little project to get started with, that combined the foundations of what we learned about html and css. I thoroughly enjoyed it although it was bit challenging in parts. I still have a lot to learn and improve on but I'm definitely enjoying the journey.
